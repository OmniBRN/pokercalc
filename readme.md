# pokercalc

This is a poker calculator I wrote in Python.

It uses the Monte Carol Method to evaluate the cards.

## Motivation

I enjoy playing poker and I don't really enjoy the services the internet provides when it comes to evaluation of poker hands. So I decided it could be fun to write my own, since it also helps me with starting a "Project" and finishing it.

It's basically finished and I think I caught most of the bugs.
